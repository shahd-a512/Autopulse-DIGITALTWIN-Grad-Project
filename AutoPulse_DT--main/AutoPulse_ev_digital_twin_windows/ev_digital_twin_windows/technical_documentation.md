# Electric Vehicle Digital Twin - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The Electric Vehicle Digital Twin project consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide a comprehensive simulation and visualization platform:

### 1. Core Simulation Engine

The core simulation engine is built around the `ElectricVehicleDigitalTwin` class, which models the behavior of an electric vehicle including:

- Battery dynamics and state of charge
- Motor performance characteristics
- Vehicle physics (acceleration, deceleration, energy consumption)
- Thermal management systems

### 2. Real-time Simulation Interface

The `RealTimeEVSimulation` class provides an interactive interface to the core simulation engine with:

- Real-time visualization of simulation data
- Interactive controls for speed and simulation parameters
- Data export capabilities
- Matplotlib-based graphical interface

### 3. Web Interface

The web interface provides a user-friendly dashboard with:

- Multiple tabs for different aspects of the vehicle
- Interactive controls and visualizations
- Report generation and download functionality
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### 4. Launcher System

The launcher system consists of several components designed for Windows compatibility:

- `enhanced_ev_launcher.py`: Combined simulation and web interface launcher
- `web_interface_launcher.py`: Standalone web interface launcher
- Batch files for easy execution on Windows

## Component Interactions

The components interact as follows:

1. The launcher scripts initialize the environment and set up paths
2. The web server is started to serve the web interface
3. The simulation backend is started (either in the same process or separately)
4. The web browser is opened to display the interface
5. User interactions with the web interface are processed by the simulation backend
6. Simulation results are displayed in real-time

## Windows Compatibility Enhancements

The following enhancements have been made to ensure Windows compatibility:

### Path Handling

- All hardcoded Unix-style paths have been replaced with platform-independent path handling
- `os.path.join()` is used for path construction
- Directory discovery is performed dynamically

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling with informative messages
- Graceful handling of common issues (missing packages, port conflicts)
- User-friendly error reporting

### Dependency Management

- Automatic checking for required Python packages
- Clear instructions for installing missing dependencies
- Simplified setup process

### Launcher System

- Multiple launcher options for different use cases
- Batch files for easy execution on Windows
- Automatic web interface opening

## Technical Details

### Web Server

- Uses Python's built-in `http.server` module
- Custom request handler for proper MIME type handling
- CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Runs on port 8000 by default

### Simulation Backend

- Matplotlib-based visualization
- Threading for non-blocking operation
- Real-time data processing
- CSV export functionality

### Browser Integration

- Uses Python's `webbrowser` module
- Automatically opens the default browser
- Falls back to manual instructions if automatic opening fails

## Development and Extension

### Adding New Features

To add new features to the simulation:

1. Extend the `ElectricVehicleDigitalTwin` class in `integration/ev_digital_twin.py`
2. Update the visualization in `enhanced_real_time_simulation.py`
3. Add corresponding elements to the web interface

### Modifying the Web Interface

The web interface can be modified by editing:

- `index.html`: Main structure and layout
- JavaScript files: Interactive behavior
- CSS files: Styling and appearance

### Changing Simulation Parameters

Simulation parameters can be modified in:

- `enhanced_real_time_simulation.py`: Default vehicle parameters
- Through the web interface at runtime

## Performance Considerations

- The simulation is designed to run in real-time on modern computers
- Graphics-intensive operations are handled by Matplotlib
- Web server performance is sufficient for local use
- Memory usage scales with simulation duration
